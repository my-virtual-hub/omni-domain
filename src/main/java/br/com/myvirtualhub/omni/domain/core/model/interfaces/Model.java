 * This is a standard interface for all business rule Model classes in the project.

 * Model classes in this context encapsulate business logic, controlling how data can

 * and easier to maintain.
 * <p>
 * Other classes in the project (like services and repositories) depend on these
 * Model interfaces for carrying out business processes effectively.
