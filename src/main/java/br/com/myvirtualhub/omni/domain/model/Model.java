 * This is a standard interface for all business rule Model classes in the project.
 * It defines a contract that all Model classes are required to follow for maintaining
 * consistency and operational correctness.
 * <p>
 * Model classes in this context encapsulate business logic, controlling how data can
 * be accessed and modified. Using models helps to keep the code structured, reusable,
 * and easier to maintain.
 * <p>
 * Other classes in the project (like services and repositories) depend on these
 * Model interfaces for carrying out business processes effectively.
