# Omni Domain

In the "omni-domain" module, the main focus is on modeling and implementing domain-specific business concepts. Here, entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services are defined and implemented, accurately reflecting the business needs and requirements.

Additionally, the "omni-domain" module facilitates the application of design patterns and best software development practices, promoting a clean and modular architecture. It fosters cohesion and low coupling between domain components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and continuously evolve the system.

Another important responsibility of the "omni-domain" module is to ensure the integrity and consistency of domain data by applying validation rules and ensuring compliance with business constraints. It acts as a layer of isolation between the application layer and data persistence, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

Through the "omni-domain" module, business operations are executed efficiently and reliably, promoting smooth and consistent execution of the application's core functionalities. Its implementation is crucial for the success of the Omni project, providing a solid and cohesive foundation for executing business operations and delivering value to end users.
